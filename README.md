# 3D-Cube-Game-Simulation
This project is a simple 3D game simulation where a cube navigates through a grid of planes, controlled by keyboard input. The game involves moving the cube left and right while avoiding randomly generated obstacles (kwtsh objects). The camera follows the cube, and the game ends when the player collides with an obstacle.

Features:
3D transformations (rotation, scaling, and translation) applied to both the cube and plane objects.
Randomly generated obstacles using 3D models.
Basic camera movement for following the cube's progression.
Double buffering technique for smooth rendering and reduced flickering.
Game over condition when the cube collides with an obstacle, displaying a "Game Over!" message.
Technologies:
C#
Windows Forms for the GUI
Custom 3D rendering logic
Feel free to explore the code, improve gameplay, and contribute!
